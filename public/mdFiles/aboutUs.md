Our Mission

      Empowering educators with tools to engage students early on climate issues, fostering responsible future leaders.

# Why Climate Education Matters?

There is a lack of comprehensive climate education in K-12 schools and leave students with only superficial knowledge. This delays their understanding of the crisis and limits opportunities for early engagement in meaningful climate action.
